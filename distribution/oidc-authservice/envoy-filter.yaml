# Notes 
# Taken from https://github.com/StatCan/aaw-kubeflow-manifest/blob/master/kustomize/oidc-authservice/envoy-filter.yaml
# 1.3 https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v1.3-branch/common/oidc-authservice/base/envoy-filter.yaml
# 1.2 https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v1.2-branch/istio/oidc-authservice/base/envoy-filter.yaml

# Looking at whats in 1.3 it seems fine, the variables in the server_uri come from the kustomization.yaml
# The one bit I'm unsure about is on line 42 about exact: kubeflow-userid but I think it is fine. 
## ^ if it's related to our change in configmap.yaml for the userid_claim then it might be funky
# I dont fully understand the config in 1.3 vs 1.2 so we just pray i guess 
# ### Getting an error of 
#error validating data: ValidationError(EnvoyFilter.spec.configPatches[0]): 
#unknown field "listener" in io.istio.networking.v1alpha3.EnvoyFilter.spec.configPatches

# I fear that there's some indenting issue upstream so try copy pasting the upstream envoy-filter.yaml
# and then seeing what happens
