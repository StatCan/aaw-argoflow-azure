# Secrets generation & management

This is a helper for creating and managing secrets. It supports:

- Kubernetes Secrets
- Sealed Secrets
- Vault Secrets (argocd vault plugin)

## Requirements

```sh
kubectl
kubeseal # if used
python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# How it works

The python script will read all `ARGOFLOW_` variables from your environment as defaults,
then it will define a bunch of tools (Dex, Keycloak, Grafana, etc) using the secrets it needs,
and it will use your requested secrets backed (kubernetes secrets, sealed secrets, vault secrets, etc).

That's it! Give it a try, with, for instance,

```sh
./argoflow_secrets.py --oauth-type keycloak generated --env-file vault.env
```
