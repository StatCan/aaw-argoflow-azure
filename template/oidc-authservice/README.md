# NOTE

This is DIFFERENT from `oidc-auth` that exists on this level (perhaps that should get renamed)
The `oidc-auth` contains information for `Dex` and `keycloak` which themselves are different
from this. 


OIDC-Authservice is meant to "extend your Istio Ingress-Gateway capabilities, to be able to function
as an OIDC client"
